# Chrome Extension Documentation: Instructional Video Enhancement Tool

## Project Overview

This Chrome extension enhances instructional videos and screen recordings by providing two key features:
1. **Spotlight Effect**: Creates a clear, rounded rectangle spotlight around the cursor with blur effect outside
2. **Arrow Drawing**: Allows drawing large, prominent red arrows to point at specific elements

Both features are activated via keyboard shortcuts and only appear while the key combinations are held down.

## Project Structure

```
/
├── manifest.json       # Extension configuration
├── background.js       # Background script for handling commands
└── content.js          # Content script for visual effects
```

## Key Features

### Spotlight Effect
- **Activation**: Press and hold Ctrl+Shift+Z
- **Behavior**: Creates a clear rounded rectangle around the cursor
- **Visual Effects**:
  - Blurs everything outside the spotlight
  - Displays a thick, animated border with color-chasing effect
  - Follows cursor movement in real-time

### Arrow Drawing
- **Activation**: Press and hold Ctrl+Shift+L
- **Behavior**: Draws a large red arrow from the initial cursor position
- **Visual Effects**:
  - Thick 12px shaft
  - Large 45px arrowhead
  - High visibility with clean edges

## Technical Implementation

### manifest.json
- Defines extension metadata, permissions, and keyboard shortcuts
- Sets up content script and background script

### background.js
- Handles keyboard commands and key state tracking
- Communicates with content script via messages
- Manages key release detection

### content.js
- Implements visual effects (spotlight and arrow)
- Handles mouse tracking and drawing
- Manages DOM manipulation for visual elements

## Detailed Prompt for Recreation

```
Create a Chrome extension that enhances instructional videos with two key features: a spotlight effect and an arrow drawing tool. Both features should only be active while specific key combinations are held down.

1. Project Structure:
   - manifest.json: Extension configuration with keyboard shortcuts
   - background.js: Command handling and key state tracking
   - content.js: Visual effects implementation

2. Spotlight Feature (Ctrl+Shift+Z):
   - When Ctrl+Shift+Z is held down, create a rounded rectangle spotlight around the cursor
   - The spotlight should be 300px wide and 200px tall with 15px rounded corners
   - Everything inside the spotlight should be clear and normal
   - Everything outside the spotlight should have a blur effect (3px blur)
   - The spotlight should have an 8px thick animated border
   - The border should have a color-chasing effect with a gradient of colors (seafoam green, blue, pink, yellow, green)
   - The spotlight should follow the cursor in real-time
   - When keys are released, the spotlight should disappear

3. Arrow Drawing Feature (Ctrl+Shift+L):
   - When Ctrl+Shift+L is held down, draw a red arrow from the initial cursor position
   - The arrow should follow the cursor movement (from start point to current cursor position)
   - The arrow should have a 12px thick shaft
   - The arrowhead should be 45px in length
   - The arrow should be bright red (#ff0000) with clean, sharp edges
   - When keys are released, the arrow should disappear

4. Technical Requirements:
   - Use Chrome extension APIs for background and content script communication
   - Implement key state tracking to handle key press and release
   - Use canvas for arrow drawing
   - Use CSS for spotlight effects
   - Ensure all visual elements have high z-index to appear above page content
   - Handle cleanup properly when keys are released

5. Extension Configuration:
   - Set appropriate permissions (scripting, activeTab, tabs)
   - Configure keyboard shortcuts in manifest.json
   - Set content script to run at document_start

The extension should work on any webpage and provide a smooth, professional experience for creating instructional videos.
```

## Implementation Details

### manifest.json
```json
{
    "manifest_version": 3,
    "name": "Instructional Video Enhancement Tool",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "Enhances instructional videos with spotlight and arrow drawing features",
    "permissions": ["scripting", "activeTab", "tabs"],
    "background": {
      "service_worker": "background.js"
    },
    "content_scripts": [
      {
        "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
        "js": ["content.js"],
        "run_at": "document_start"
      }
    ],
    "commands": {
      "start_arrow_draw": {
        "suggested_key": {
          "default": "Ctrl+Shift+L"
        },
        "description": "Draw arrow"
      },
      "zoom_in": {
        "suggested_key": {
          "default": "Ctrl+Shift+Z"
        },
        "description": "Activate spotlight"
      }
    }
}
```

### Key Implementation Challenges

1. **Spotlight Border Animation**:
   - Using CSS border-image with linear gradients
   - Implementing keyframe animations for the color-chasing effect
   - Ensuring consistent border width on all sides

2. **Arrow Drawing Precision**:
   - Calculating proper angles for the arrowhead
   - Ensuring clean rendering with appropriate stroke and fill
   - Handling real-time updates as the mouse moves

3. **Key State Management**:
   - Tracking key states in the background script
   - Setting up key release listeners
   - Ensuring proper cleanup when keys are released

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Using requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
   - Minimizing DOM manipulations
   - Efficient canvas drawing and clearing

## Testing Instructions

1. Load the extension in Chrome's developer mode
2. Navigate to any webpage
3. Test the spotlight feature:
   - Press and hold Ctrl+Shift+Z
   - Move your cursor around the page
   - Release the keys to deactivate
4. Test the arrow drawing feature:
   - Press and hold Ctrl+Shift+L
   - Move your cursor to draw an arrow
   - Release the keys to remove the arrow

## Future Enhancements

1. **Customization Options**:
   - Add settings panel to customize colors, sizes, and effects
   - Allow saving presets for different use cases

2. **Additional Features**:
   - Text annotation capability
   - Shape drawing tools (rectangles, circles)
   - Screenshot functionality

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Optimize rendering for complex web pages
   - Reduce memory usage for long sessions
